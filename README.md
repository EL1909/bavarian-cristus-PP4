#  [Bavarian Cristus](https://bcristus.herokuapp.com/)

[Click here to visit the site.](https://bcristus.herokuapp.com)

Bavarian Cristus is a website created by Luciano Fernández with the purpouse of allowing all people interested in Jesus Christ, that also enjoy to take and share photos, and happen to be residents or visiting Bavaria, to share their pictures and thoughts about images shared by others.

Users of the website are able to see images and also upload their own taken photos to a Jesus statue, as long as they are taken within Bavaria.

They will be also able to tag the location of the photo. This will allow visitors to find exactly where the statue is located.

In the home page, visitors can watch a list of post; each card appears to be a traditional PostCard. !! Among others, an expected update of this website will be allowing to create a PDF file from those post card; to be shared or even sent per post upon request.

The post card contains an image and information about the author of the picture; !! those fields as well as messages could be printed or not upon request of the member using checkboxes. Members of the community can also comment and like other posts.

In this version, each post have a location tag to locate the statue. !! in future releases, the user will be able to tag the exact location, this is with the purpouse of making routes for tourists and groups of visitors and guided tours.

Footer; in the footer there's access to social network and the traditional rights reservation statement.

The website is written within github development enviroment, using Django as MVC (MVT) framework and deployed to Heroku. All images and static files are being hosted in Cloudinary.

## Working Methodology

In order to achieve this first release, i set up tasks having in mind an Agile mindset and stablishing goals to be completed within weekly iterations.

Placing myself in the user's position, and anticipating the user's wants and needs, i made myself the following questions:

Why would a user want to visit our blog?
What will make them return
What do i want to see when I visit a blog
What would make me return

From those answer I did set up 17 issues in GitHub as User Stories.

### User Stories

- EPICS
    - User Storys

- I can see photos posted by other users on this particular topic with no hassel.
    - As a user, I can see photos posted by other users so that i get interest on becoming a member.
    - As a user, I can see comments on each photo post so that i get interest on becoming a member.
        
- To be part of a community.

## Database Design
    
### Models

I will be using three diferent database models for this project: User, ImagePost and Comments,

The User class is the default User class from Django.

The ImagePost class is the key custom class in this project as the main function of the site is for users to share their own taken images, both inherit from models.Model.


class ImagePost(models.Model):

    title = models.CharField(max_length=200, unique=False)
    slug = models.SlugField(max_length=200, unique=True)
    user = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='uploaded_images')
    author = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    image = CloudinaryField('image')
    location = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    created_on = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    text = models.TextField()
    excerpt = models.TextField()
    status = models.IntegerField(choices=STATUS, default=0)
    likes = models.ManyToManyField(User, related_name='image_likes', blank=True)



class Comment(models.Model):

    text = models.TextField()
    image_post = models.ForeignKey(ImagePost, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='comments')
    user = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='comments_made')
    name = models.CharField(max_length=80)
    email = models.EmailField()
    created_on = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    approved = models.BooleanField(default=False)


### Database Relationships

I found is necessary to have two foreign keys in the Comment model to establish a relationship between the Comment model, the ImagePost model, and the User model.

The image_post foreign key in the Comment model is used to associate each comment with an specific image post. This creates a one-to-many relationship between the ImagePost model and the Comment model, as each ImagePost can have multiple Comment instances associated with it.

The user foreign key in the Comment model is used to track the user who made the comment. This creates a one-to-many relationship between the User model and the Comment model, as each User can have multiple Comment instances associated with it.
